# AWS Cloud Fundamentals & Hands-On Projects

Welcome to my AWS Cloud & DevOps learning journey! This repository documents my hands-on projects and structured notes covering key AWS services, cloud infrastructure, networking, security, compute, and DevOps practices, with a strong focus on real-world implementation.

It is designed to serve as:

A personal learning reference for cloud and DevOps skills

A practical AWS portfolio showcasing hands-on projects

A demonstration of real-world cloud deployment and automation skills

---

## What This Repository Covers

AWS Account Setup & Best Practices – creating accounts, IAM users, groups, roles, and governance using AWS Organizations

Identity & Access Management (IAM) – permissions, policies, and secure access

Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) Networking – VPC creation, subnets, route tables, gateways, and network security

EC2 Compute & Web Application Deployment – launching instances, configuring Linux servers, deploying web apps, and managing DNS

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) & Automation – automating deployments with GitHub Actions, Terraform, and AWS tools

Cloud Security & Monitoring – MFA, secure SSH access, logging, and monitoring

Project Breakdown
AWS Account Setup
Covers the foundational steps for setting up an AWS environment, including:

AWS account creation:
IAM users, groups, roles, and access best practices

AWS Organisations and account governance

VPC Networking:
Focuses on AWS networking fundamentals
VPC creation and design

Public and private subnets
Route tables, Internet Gateway, and NAT concepts
Security Groups vs Network ACLs
EC2 Compute & Web Application Deployment
A hands-on project demonstrating real-world AWS usage:
Launching an EC2 instance inside an existing VPC
Secure server access using SSH
Installing and configuring Nginx on Ubuntu
Deploying a web application from GitHub
Configuring a custom domain and DNS records
Validating public access via IP address and domain name

This project ties together networking, security, compute, and DNS in a practical deployment scenario.

Skills Demonstrated
AWS core services (EC2, VPC, IAM, Organisations)
Linux server administration and SSH management
Web server configuration (Nginx)
DNS and domain setup
Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, CloudFormation)
CI/CD automation with GitHub Actions
Cloud troubleshooting, validation, and best practices
Git & GitHub for version control and project documentation

Ongoing Improvements
This repository is actively maintained and will be expanded to include:
Load Balancing (ALB/NLB)
Auto Scaling Groups
Enhanced IAM security practices
High availability and resilient cloud architectures
