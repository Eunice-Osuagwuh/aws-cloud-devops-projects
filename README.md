# Cloud Engineering & DevOps Hands-On Portfolio

Welcome to my Cloud Engineering and DevOps learning journey.

This repository documents hands-on projects across Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services, covering cloud infrastructure, networking, security, compute, Linux administration, and automation.

The goal of this repository is to demonstrate practical, real-world cloud implementation skills and continuous growth toward production-ready infrastructure engineering.

## Purpose of This Repository

This portfolio serves as:

• A structured cloud engineering learning reference
• A multi-cloud hands-on project showcase
• A demonstration of infrastructure deployment and troubleshooting skills
• A foundation for DevOps automation and Infrastructure as Code
